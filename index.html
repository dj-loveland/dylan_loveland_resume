					<p>
						Hello, my name is Dylan and welcome to my page. I am currently working as a Test Analyst at PPS Mutual South Africa and have a keen interest in the world of IT.<br>
						In the past I have worked various jobs such as a QA for printing jobs, an Able Seaman in the South African Navy as well as a Intern Java Programmer. I have enjoyed the working opportunities I have experienced so far; However I find my time working as a Developer to be the fulfilling and rewarding, and I would like to grow within this career further. <br>
					<br>
						I have many passions and interests, which vary from maintaining a healthy lifestyle and enjoying nature, to learning new things such as financial wellbeing, studying history and other topics that keep my mind active and curious. My work experience has encouraged and taught me to be self-motivated, rather than relying on the input and assistance of others; even achieving the smaller daily goals keeps me focused and invested in the next task.<br>
					<br>
						I am hopeful for the future and have many personal goals. I want to be able to grow in whatever it is I do, be it in a professional or personal capacity. I am willing to learn and strive to be exceptional in all that I do. 
					</p>

Automation is also run to create test cases, as well as various other uses on the system, however this is just the execution and not the actual coding of the automation functionality (Though I will hope to one day do such).</td>
